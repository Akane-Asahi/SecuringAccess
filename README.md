# SecuringAccess

Scenario

The security professional is employed at a health care company and has the responsibility of regularly updating a file that outlines the employees authorized to access restricted content, particularly those working with personal patient records. The access control is based on IP addresses, with an allow list specifying which IP addresses are permitted to access the restricted subnetwork. Additionally, there exists a remove list that identifies the employees whose IP addresses must be removed from the allow list.

The task at hand requires the security professional to develop an algorithm using Python code to examine whether the allow list contains any of the IP addresses mentioned in the remove list. If such addresses are found, they must be removed from the file containing the allow list.
